This is a post to try out including source code in the post.


It doesn't show the syntax highlighting in the main page...

<!--more-->

{{< highlight java  >}}
public static void main(String [] args) {

}
{{< / highlight >}}

Does this work?

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```
